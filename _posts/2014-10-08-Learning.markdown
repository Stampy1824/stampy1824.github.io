title: Learning out of order

Impatience, procrastination, and a go-gettum attitude have always served me extraordinarily well. I understand that we're trying to learn about each individual building block before we decide to go and build a gigantic house, but I've never been good at masonry, and I always seem to build better houses by knocking a few down first. See, while I know that it is important to go through and learn about declaring objects, learning JSON, and how to float elements before implementing them all into a bigger project, I inevitably always end up going back and re-learning aboaut these things when I sink my teeth into a bigger project. For this reason, I've had some trouble finding motivation to go through and do some of the homework exercises that we've been assigned in the past few weeks.

Pre-work: 2 sections devoted to declaring objects and putting them into practice.

Homework: Go declare these objects. 

Its like I'm a kid that doesn't want to eat his veggies.

I just feel like I'm going two steps forward and one step back. Seems like its high time I stop bitching about this and just go try to implement this into some project. The problem I'm having is that I don't know what this project should be. How can I tie all of these shiny new knowledges together in something that will stimulate and motivate my lazy brain? 



 What kind of project would this be? Seems like its google to the rescue, or try to skip ahead. 

Also I really need to stop playing Destiny. Really I should swear off of video games until this class is over. I will thank myself later. Someone come hide my playstation from me. Please.
