<h1>9/10/14</h1>   
It is Day 2 of the Makersquare frontend class, I'm still finishing up the jQuery pre-work, and every time I think I get it, something else comes up that I don't get. I suppose that's how it goes though. I'm excited to plug it into this blog project or other future projects. I think figuring out how to efficiently use classes and ids in my HTML will make using jQuery easier.
This is kind of how I feel in class right now:

Its not that I don't understand what's going on, but rather that I know that this learning is up to me, and I just have to jump in to find questions.
